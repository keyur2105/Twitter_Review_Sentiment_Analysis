# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter reviews using Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, TextBlob, and WordCloud. The analysis includes data preprocessing, sentiment polarity calculation, and visualization of positive comments through a word cloud.

## Features

- Data Loading and Cleaning: Reads a CSV file containing Twitter reviews, handles missing values, and preprocesses the text data.
- Sentiment Analysis: Utilizes TextBlob to compute the polarity of each review, categorizing them as positive, neutral, or negative.
- Data Visualization: Generates a word cloud to visualize the most frequent words in positive reviews.
